  "description": "Create rigorous customer-first product documentation for product builders. Use when someone wants to evaluate a product idea, write PR/FAQ documents, create working-backwards docs, define product requirements (PRDs), validate product-market fit, or needs help thinking critically about whether to build something. Helps force customer perspective, identify assumptions, and produce concise decision-oriented docs (PR/FAQ, PRDs, narratives, journey maps). Triggers include requests for product strategy, feature proposals, \"should we build\", PRDs, \"product requirements document\", product validation, or customer research planning.",

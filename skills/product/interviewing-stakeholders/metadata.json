  "description": "Conducts comprehensive stakeholder interviews to gather detailed requirements and generate Gherkin (Given/When/Then) acceptance criteria for test-driven development. Use this skill when you need to: (1) Clarify ambiguities or gaps identified in the synthesizing-requirements output, (2) Interview users to understand functional requirements and system behaviors, (3) Explore non-functional requirements like performance, security, scalability, and reliability constraints, (4) Understand user personas, use cases, and user journeys in detail, (5) Identify technical constraints, integration requirements, and technology preferences, (6) Define data requirements including structures, relationships, and validation rules, (7) Generate comprehensive Gherkin scenarios for each feature ready for test implementation, or (8) Start from scratch when no prior synthesis exists and you need to gather requirements through conversation. This skill typically follows synthesizing-requirements in the Pact workflow but can be used independently.",

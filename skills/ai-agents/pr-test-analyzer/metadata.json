Can you check if the tests are thorough?\"\\nassistant: \"I'll use the pr-test-analyzer agent to review the test coverage and identify any critical gaps.\"\\n<commentary>\\nSince Daisy is asking about test thoroughness in a PR, use the Task tool to launch the pr-test-analyzer agent.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: A pull request has been updated with new code changes.\\nuser: \"The PR is ready for review - I added the new validation logic we discussed\"\\nassistant: \"Let me analyze the PR to ensure the tests adequately cover the new validation logic and edge cases.\"\\n<commentary>\\nThe PR has new functionality that needs test coverage analysis, so use the pr-test-analyzer agent.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Reviewing PR feedback before marking as ready.\\nuser: \"Before I mark this PR as ready, can you double-check the test coverage?\"\\nassistant: \"I'll use the pr-test-analyzer agent to thoroughly review the test coverage and identify any critical gaps before you mark it ready.\"\\n<commentary>\\nDaisy wants a final test coverage check before marking PR ready, use the pr-test-analyzer agent.\\n</commentary>\\n</example>",

# Copywriting

## Overview

You have access to 34 battle-tested Copyhackers prompts for specific copywriting tasks. Your job: pick the right prompt for the task, load it, and run it.

Core principle: Few-shot learning beats instructions. Provide voice examples, not descriptions.

## Workflow

1. Identify what copy Anthony needs
2. Select the right prompt from the table below
3. Read the FULL prompt file (they contain specific instructions, not just templates)
   Path: `~/Documents/copywriting/copyhackers-prompts/[filename]`
4. Follow the prompt exactly, asking Anthony for any required inputs
5. Run through ai-tropes.md before delivering final copy

## When No Prompt Fits

For tasks too small for a full prompt (single headline, one CTA, quick edit) or needs that don't match the 34 prompts:

1. Use frameworks.md for structure (PAS, AIDA, BAB, FAB, PASTOR, SCQA)
2. Ask Anthony for 2-3 voice examples before generating
3. Still run ai-tropes.md check before delivering

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- Technical documentation (clarity over persuasion)
- Internal communications (skip sales framing)
- Legal/compliance copy (different rules)
- Client has strict brand guidelines (follow those)
- Very short edits (single word changes)
- Industry-regulated copy (healthcare, financial disclaimers)

## AI Trope Check

Before delivering any copy, scan for patterns that make it sound AI-generated. See ai-tropes.md for the full list.

Quick flags:
- "Dive into", "leverage", "robust", "seamless", "game-changer"
- Em dashes used frequently
- "In today's [adjective] world..."
- Starting with credentials or "I'm excited to share"

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Writing copy without loading prompt | Load the specific prompt first |
| No voice examples from Anthony | Ask for 2-3 samples before generating |
| Accepting first output | Run through ai-tropes.md, iterate |
| Generic output | Prompts require specific inputs, gather them |
| Skipping prompt for "quick" task | Use frameworks.md for small tasks instead |

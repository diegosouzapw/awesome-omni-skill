# Upstash Search Documentation

## Quick Start

Install the TS SDK:

```
npm install @upstash/search
```

Create a client and perform a simple upsert + search:

```
import { Search } from "@upstash/search";

const client = new Search({ url: process.env.UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_URL, token: process.env.UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_TOKEN });
const index = client.index("my-index");

await index.upsert({ id: "1", content: { text: "hello world" } });
const results = await index.search({ query: "hello" });
```

Basic steps:
- Create an index
- Insert or update documents
- Run searches or filtered queries

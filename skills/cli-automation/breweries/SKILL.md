## Agent Implementation Notes

**Platform note:** If your human is on Windows, they'll need WSL, Git Bash, or Cygwin to run this skill.

**Script location:** `{skill_folder}/breweries` (wrapper) → `scripts/breweries`

**When user asks about breweries:**
1. Run `./breweries search "name"` to find by name
2. Run `./breweries city "city"` for location-based search
3. Run `./breweries state "state"` for state-wide search
4. Run `./breweries type brewpub` for specific types
5. Run `./breweries random` for discovery/recommendations

**Common patterns:**
- "Find me a brewery in [city]" → `breweries city "[city]"`
- "What breweries are in [state]?" → `breweries state "[state]"`
- "Search for [name] brewery" → `breweries search "[name]"`
- "Surprise me with a brewery" → `breweries random`
- "Where can I get craft beer in [city]?" → `breweries city "[city]"` or `breweries type micro`

**Don't use for:** Bars without brewing, liquor stores, wine/spirits.

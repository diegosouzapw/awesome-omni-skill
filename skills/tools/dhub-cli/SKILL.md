# dhub CLI Guide

`dhub` is the AI skill manager for data science agents. It publishes, discovers, installs, and runs Skills — modular packages (code + prompts) that agents like Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and Windsurf can use.

## Installation

```bash
uv tool install dhub-cli    # via uv (recommended)
pipx install dhub-cli       # via pipx
```

```

See `references/command_reference.md` for full details on every command, flag, and option.

## Environments (Dev / Prod)

dhub supports two independent stacks controlled by `DHUB_ENV`:

| Env | API URL | Config File |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `prod` (default) | `https://lfiaschi--api.modal.run` | `~/.dhub/config.prod.json` |
| `dev` | `https://lfiaschi--api-dev.modal.run` | `~/.dhub/config.dev.json` |

Always prefix commands with `DHUB_ENV=dev` when working against the dev stack:

```bash
DHUB_ENV=dev dhub login
DHUB_ENV=dev dhub list
DHUB_ENV=dev dhub publish
```

The `dhub env` command shows the currently active environment, config path, and API URL.

## Authentication

dhub uses GitHub Device Flow (OAuth2). Run `dhub login` and follow the prompts:

1. dhub requests a device code from the server
2. You open `https://github.com/login/device` and enter the displayed code
3. dhub polls until you authorize (up to 5 minutes)
4. Token is saved to `~/.dhub/config.{env}.json`

All subsequent commands use this token automatically. Run `dhub logout` to clear it.

You can override the API URL with `dhub login --api-url <url>` for custom deployments.

## Publishing Workflow

### Quick publish (auto-detect everything)

From a directory containing a valid SKILL.md:

```bash
dhub publish              # auto-detects org, name, bumps patch version
dhub publish --minor      # bump minor version instead
dhub publish --major      # bump major version
dhub publish --version 2.0.0  # explicit version
```

### Explicit publish

```bash
dhub publish myorg/my-skill          # specify org/skill, auto-bump patch
dhub publish myorg/my-skill ./path   # specify path to skill directory
```

### How auto-detection works

1. **Skill name** — read from `name` field in SKILL.md frontmatter
2. **Organization** — auto-detected if you belong to exactly one org. If you have multiple, specify explicitly: `dhub publish myorg/my-skill`
3. **Version** — fetches latest version from registry, bumps patch by default. First publish uses `0.1.0`

### Argument disambiguation

The first positional argument is interpreted as:
- A **path** if it starts with `.`, `/`, `~`, or is an existing directory
- An **org/skill reference** otherwise

So `dhub publish .` and `dhub publish myorg/skill` both work as expected.

### Safety grading

After publishing, the server runs safety checks and assigns a grade:

| Grade | Meaning | Effect |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **A** | Clean — no elevated permissions or risky patterns | Normal installation |
| **B** | Elevated permissions detected | Warning shown on install |
| **C** | Ambiguous/risky patterns | Users need `--allow-risky` flag to install |
| **F** | Rejected — fails safety checks | Publish is rejected (HTTP 422) |

If the skill has an `evals` block, agent evaluation runs after publish and the CLI automatically attaches to the live log stream. Press Ctrl-C to detach; re-attach later with `dhub logs`.

### What gets zipped

The publish command creates a zip of the skill directory, excluding:
- Hidden files (names starting with `.`)
- `__pycache__/` directories

## Publishing from a Git Repository

You can pass a git URL directly to `dhub publish`:

```bash
dhub publish https://github.com/myorg/my-skills-repo
dhub publish git@github.com:myorg/my-skills-repo.git --ref v2.0
dhub publish https://github.com/myorg/repo --minor
```

The command detects that the argument is a git URL (HTTPS, SSH, or `.git` suffix), clones the repository, recursively discovers all directories containing a valid SKILL.md, and publishes each one. This is useful for monorepos containing multiple skills.

### How discovery works

1. The repo is cloned (shallow clone with `--depth 1`)
2. All `SKILL.md` files are found recursively
3. Hidden directories (`.git`, etc.), `node_modules`, and `__pycache__` are skipped
4. Each `SKILL.md` is validated — only directories with valid frontmatter (name + description) are published
5. Skills are published one by one; failures don't stop the remaining skills

### Git-specific options

- `--ref` — branch, tag, or commit to checkout (only valid with git URLs)

## Installing Skills

```bash
dhub install myorg/my-skill                          # latest version
dhub install myorg/my-skill --version 1.2.0          # specific version
dhub install myorg/my-skill --agent claude-code        # install + link to Claude Code
dhub install myorg/my-skill --agent all                # link to all agents
dhub install myorg/my-skill --allow-risky             # allow Grade C skills
```

### Where skills get installed

- **Canonical path**: `~/.dhub/skills/{org}/{skill}/`
- **Agent symlinks** (when using `--agent`):

| Agent | `--agent` | Symlink Location |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Claude Code | `claude-code` | `~/.claude/skills/{skill}` |
| Cursor | `cursor` | `~/.cursor/skills/{skill}` |
| Codex | `codex` | `~/.codex/skills/{skill}` |
| Windsurf | `windsurf` | `~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/{skill}` |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini-cli` | `~/.gemini/skills/{skill}` |
| GitHub Copilot | `github-copilot` | `~/.copilot/skills/{skill}` |
| Roo Code | `roo` | `~/.roo/skills/{skill}` |
| OpenCode | `opencode` | `~/.config/opencode/skills/{skill}` |

40+ agents supported. Run `dhub install org/skill --agent all` to link to every agent. See the README for the full list.

Symlinks point to the canonical `~/.dhub/skills/` path, so the skill is stored once and shared across agents.

### After installation: load the skill immediately

When you install a skill on behalf of the user, **always read it into the current conversation** so it's usable right away. Don't tell the user to start a new session.

After `dhub install` succeeds:
1. Read the installed skill's `SKILL.md` from `~/.dhub/skills/{org}/{skill}/SKILL.md`
2. Confirm to the user that the skill is loaded and ready to use now

Don't read reference files upfront — the SKILL.md itself will tell you when to consult specific references.

The user installed a skill because they want to use it — treat installation as implicit activation.

### Integrity verification

Downloads are verified via SHA-256 checksum before extraction. If the checksum doesn't match, installation aborts.

## Running Skills Locally

```bash
dhub run myorg/my-skill              # run the skill
dhub run myorg/my-skill -- --flag    # pass extra args to the entrypoint
```

### Prerequisites

- The skill must be installed locally (`dhub install` first)
- The skill must have a `runtime` block in its SKILL.md
- `uv` must be available on PATH
- Required environment variables (from `runtime.env`) must be set
- Only `language: python` is supported

### What happens

1. Parses SKILL.md to get runtime config
2. Validates prerequisites (uv, lockfile, entrypoint, env vars)
3. Runs `uv sync --directory {skill_dir}` to install dependencies
4. Runs `uv run --directory {skill_dir} python {entrypoint} [extra_args]`

## Eval Reports

View evaluation results for a published skill version:

```bash
dhub eval-report myorg/my-skill@1.0.0
```

The report shows:
- **Agent** used for the eval run
- **Judge model** that evaluated the output
- **Status**: passed, failed, error, pending
- **Results**: pass/fail count and per-case details with reasoning

Evals run automatically in the background after publishing a skill that has an `evals` block. Use `dhub eval-report` to check results.

## Eval Logs (Real-Time Streaming)

Tail eval run logs in real-time, or view recent runs:

```bash
dhub logs                              # list recent eval runs
dhub logs myorg/my-skill --follow      # tail latest run for latest version
dhub logs myorg/my-skill@1.0.0 -f      # tail latest run for specific version
dhub logs <run-id> --follow            # tail a specific run by ID
```

When you publish a skill with evals, the CLI automatically attaches to the log stream. Press Ctrl-C to detach — you can re-attach later with `dhub logs`.

Events include: sandbox setup, agent stdout/stderr, judge start, case verdicts (PASS/FAIL), and a final summary.

## API Key Management

Skills that use third-party APIs during evaluation need API keys stored in Decision Hub:

```bash
dhub keys add OPENAI_API_KEY        # prompts securely for the value
dhub keys list                      # show stored key names
dhub keys remove OPENAI_API_KEY     # delete a stored key
```

Keys are stored server-side (encrypted) and injected into eval sandbox environments. Key names must match the `runtime.env` entries in SKILL.md.

## Organization Management

```bash
dhub org list    # list namespaces you can publish to
```

Your namespaces are derived from your GitHub account and org memberships. Run `dhub login` to refresh memberships after joining new GitHub orgs.

## Skill Discovery

```bash
dhub ask "analyze A/B test results"
dhub ask "generate presentation slides"
```

Natural language search across all published skills. Returns matching skills with descriptions and install instructions.

## Scaffolding a New Skill

```bash
dhub init                  # interactive — prompts for name and description
dhub init ./my-skill       # create in a specific directory
```

Creates:
```
my-skill/
  SKILL.md     # frontmatter + body skeleton
  src/         # source code directory
```

## SKILL.md Format (Quick Reference)

```yaml
---
name: my-skill                 # 1-64 chars, lowercase + hyphens
description: What it does      # 1-1024 chars, triggers skill activation
license: MIT                   # optional
runtime:                       # optional — for executable skills
  language: python
  entrypoint: src/main.py
  env: [OPENAI_API_KEY]
  dependencies:
    package_manager: uv
    lockfile: uv.lock
evals:                         # optional — for testable skills
  agent: claude
  judge_model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
---
System prompt for the agent goes here.
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection timed out" or slow first request
Modal cold starts take 30-60s. Retry after a minute. All dhub HTTP calls use 60s timeouts internally.

### "No namespaces available"
Run `dhub login` to refresh GitHub org memberships. You need at least one org to publish.

### "You have multiple namespaces"
Specify the org explicitly: `dhub publish myorg/my-skill` instead of `dhub publish`.

### "Version X already exists"
Versions are immutable. Bump the version: `dhub publish --patch` (or `--minor`, `--major`), or use `--version` with a new number.

### "Rejected (Grade F)"
The skill failed safety checks. Review your SKILL.md and scripts for dangerous patterns (shell injection, credential exfiltration, etc.).

### "Skill not installed" when running
Install first with `dhub install org/skill`, then `dhub run org/skill`.

### "This skill has no runtime configuration"
Only skills with a `runtime` block can be run via `dhub run`. Prompt-only skills don't need `dhub run`.

### "Checksum mismatch"
Download was corrupted. Retry `dhub install`. If it persists, the server package may be damaged — try re-publishing.

### Wrong environment
Check with `dhub env`. Set `DHUB_ENV=dev` or `DHUB_ENV=prod` before commands.

### Config file location
- Dev: `~/.dhub/config.dev.json`
- Prod: `~/.dhub/config.prod.json`
- Override API URL: `DHUB_API_URL` env var (highest priority)

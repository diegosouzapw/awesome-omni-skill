description: CLI tool for creating Linear issues and checking velocity rankings
---

## Setup

Requires `LINEAR_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export LINEAR_API_KEY="lin_api_..."
```

## Commands

### Create an Issue

```bash
linearite create "Issue title" --team-id <TEAM_ID> [--description "..."] [--project-id <PROJECT_ID>]
```

Short flags: `-t` (team), `-d` (description), `-p` (project)

Output includes the issue URL and suggested git branch name.

### Discovery

```bash
linearite list-teams     # Get team IDs
linearite list-projects  # Get project IDs
```

### Velocity Rankings

```bash
linearite rank-teams [--since 14d] [--top 10]
linearite rank-users [--since 14d] [--top 10]
```

`--since` accepts: `7d`, `30d`, `2025-01-01`, or ISO 8601 dates.

## Workflows

### Quick Issue Creation

1. Find the team ID: `linearite list-teams`
2. Create: `linearite create "Fix auth bug" -t <TEAM_ID> -d "Users getting logged out after 5 minutes"`

### Sprint Velocity Check

```bash
linearite rank-users --since 14d --top 5
```

### Assign to Project

```bash
linearite list-projects
linearite create "New feature" -t <TEAM_ID> -p <PROJECT_ID>
```

## Notes

- Only completed issues with estimates count toward velocity rankings
- Branch names are auto-generated by Linear, not this CLI
- All commands require valid API key in environment

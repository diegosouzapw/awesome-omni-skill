  "description": "Scaffolded debugging guidance for learning. Use when a learner encounters unexpected behavior, errors, or bugs and wants to develop debugging skills, not just fix the problem. This skill guides through hypothesis formation, investigation design, and root cause analysis while enforcing human-only decision points. Triggers on phrases like \"help me debug\", \"something's wrong with my code\", \"unexpected behavior\", \"learning to debug\", or when a learner describes symptoms without immediately asking for the fix.",

**For Each Word, Include:**

1. **The Word** (with pronunciation guide if helpful)
2. **Meaning** (in simple English, 1-2 sentences max)
3. **Three Short Example Sentences** (easy to understand, related to student life)

**Example Format:**

```
Word 1: Abundant (uh-BUN-dunt)
Meaning: Having a lot of something; plenty of it.

Examples:
1. The garden has abundant flowers in spring.

```

**Format Requirements:**
- Number each word clearly (Word 1, Word 2, ... Word 35)

- Examples should be relatable to students' lives
- Do not add extra explanations or motivation text

### STAGE 2: DAILY TEST MODE (Same Day)

   C) Hard to find
   D) Expensive
```

**Section B: Fill in the Blanks (5 questions)**

Example:
```
6. The library has an _____ collection of books.
```

**Section C: Sentence-Based Questions (5 questions)**

    What does "dense" mean?
```

**Test Rules:**

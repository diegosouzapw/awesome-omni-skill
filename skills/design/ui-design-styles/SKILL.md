# UI Design Styles

This skill provides specialized knowledge and workflows for implementing the most popular modern UI design styles. It focuses on achieving a professional, polished look while maintaining high standards for accessibility and legibility.

## Core UI Styles

Select the style that best fits the project's goals:

- **Soft UI / Modern Design**: Best for friendly, inviting B2C interfaces. Uses subtle gradients and lifelike shadows. See [soft_ui.md](references/soft_ui.md).
- **Dark Mode**: Essential for modern apps. Focuses on hierarchy through lighting and OLED-friendly black levels. See [dark_mode.md](references/dark_mode.md).
- **Flat Design**: Focuses on minimalism, high-contrast typography, and clarity. Great for e-commerce and luxury brands. See [flat_design.md](references/flat_design.md).
- **Neumorphism**: A stylized "extruded plastic" look. Best used sparingly for specific container elements. See [neumorphism.md](references/neumorphism.md).
- **Glassmorphism**: A frosted glass effect using background blur and transparency. Adds depth and a premium feel. See [glassmorphism.md](references/glassmorphism.md).
- **Aurora UI Gradients**: Organic, blurry, northern-lights-style backgrounds. Excellent for ornamentation and pairing with Glassmorphism. See [aurora_ui.md](references/aurora_ui.md).

## General Design Principles

Regardless of the chosen style, always apply these fundamental practices:

1. **Accessibility First**: Design styles should never impair the user's ability to navigate or read essential content. If a style (like Glassmorphism) causes legibility issues, it must be refined or limited to non-essential elements.
2. **Hierarchy through Depth**: Use the "top-down lighting" model. Elements closer to the user should be lighter and/or have more prominent shadows/transparency.
3. **Color Harmony**: Avoid pure black/white when possible. Tint grays and backgrounds with a hint of the primary brand color to create a more cohesive and professional feel.
4. **Consistent Roundness**: Choose a corner radius (e.g., 8px, 16px) and apply it consistently across all components to maintain visual unity.

Use when a user wants to build a project that was validated and planned on CoFounder.im — lists projects, fetches the full build spec (tech stack, MVP plan, UI/UX, implementation plan, OpenClaw builder output), and helps orchestrate sub-agents to build it. Trigger phrases — \"build my CoFounder project\", \"pull my project from cofounder.im\", \"use my CoFounder build spec\", \"start building from CoFounder\", \"fetch my startup plan\", \"build from cofounder\".",

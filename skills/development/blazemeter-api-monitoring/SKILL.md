# BlazeMeter API Monitoring

Comprehensive guide for creating, configuring, and managing API Monitoring tests in BlazeMeter.

## Overview

API Monitoring enables continuous testing of APIs with support for REST, GraphQL, SOAP, and custom scripting. This skill covers all aspects of API Monitoring from basic test creation to advanced integrations and management.

## Quick Start

1. **Creating tests**: Configure test steps, behaviors, and locations
2. **Scripting**: Use Initial Script, Pre-request Scripts, and Post-response Scripts
3. **Integrations**: Connect with 30+ third-party services
4. **Management**: Organize tests with teams, buckets, and RBAC

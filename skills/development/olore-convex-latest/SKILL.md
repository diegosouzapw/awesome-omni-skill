| Core database | `contents/database.mdx`, `contents/database/reading-data/reading-data.mdx` |
| Functions | `contents/functions/query-functions.mdx`, `contents/functions/mutation-functions.mdx` |
| Authentication | `contents/auth.mdx`, `contents/auth/clerk.mdx` |
| AI agents | `contents/agents/getting-started.mdx` |
| File storage | `contents/file-storage.mdx` |
| Real-time updates | `contents/realtime.mdx` |
| Production deployment | `contents/production.mdx` |
| Client libraries | `contents/client/react.mdx`, `contents/client/nextjs/` |
| API reference | `contents/generated-api/` |

## When to use

Use this skill when the user asks about:
- Convex database queries, mutations, and schemas
- Real-time data synchronization and reactive queries
- Serverless functions (queries, mutations, actions)
- Authentication with Clerk, Auth0, or custom JWT
- File storage and serving
- Scheduled jobs and cron tasks
- Text search and vector search
- AI agents and chatbot functionality
- Client libraries (React, Next.js, Vue, Python, etc.)
- Production deployment and hosting

## How to find information

1. **First**, read `TOC.md` for complete file listing organized by directory
2. Identify relevant section based on user's question
3. Read specific files for details

**TOC.md contains all files organized by directory - always check it first.**

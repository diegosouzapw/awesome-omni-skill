  "description": "Privacy and security annotation for Mermaid diagrams. Use this skill when: (1) a user shares or creates a Mermaid flowchart or sequence diagram and asks for privacy, security, or compliance review, (2) a user asks to annotate a diagram with data classifications, controls, trust boundaries, or compliance scope, (3) a user mentions 'privgraph', '@pg:', or 'risk-informed diagram', (4) a user asks about data flow risks, missing controls, or GDPR/HIPAA/PCI compliance gaps in an architecture diagram, (5) a user is writing a design doc with Mermaid diagrams and wants privacy/security feedback embedded in the diagram itself. Do NOT use for general Mermaid syntax help, diagram styling, or non-security topics.",

  "description": "Audit Cursor IDE rules (.mdc files) against quality standards using a 5-gate review process. Validates frontmatter (YAML syntax, required fields, description quality, triggering configuration), glob patterns (specificity, performance, correctness), content quality (focus, organization, examples, cross-references), file length (under 500 lines recommended), and functionality (triggering, cross-references, maintainability). Use when reviewing pull requests with Cursor rule changes, conducting periodic rule quality audits, validating new rules before committing, identifying improvement opportunities, preparing rules for team sharing, or debugging why rules aren't working as expected.",

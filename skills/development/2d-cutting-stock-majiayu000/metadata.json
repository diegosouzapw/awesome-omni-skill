Also use when the user mentions \"2D cutting,\" \"sheet cutting optimization,\" \"panel cutting,\" \"glass cutting,\" \"steel plate cutting,\" \"guillotine cutting patterns,\" \"two-stage cutting,\" or \"2D trim loss.\" For 1D problems, see 1d-cutting-stock. For bin packing, see 2d-bin-packing. For irregular shapes, see nesting-optimization.",

  "name": "python-core",
  "description": "Create, write, build, debug, test, refactor, and optimize Python 3.10+ applications across all domains (data science, backend APIs, scripting, automation). Manage dependencies with uv (preferred), poetry, or pip. Implement type hints (typing module, generics, protocols), write tests with pytest (fixtures, parametrize, mocking), work with pandas DataFrames (creation, selection, groupby, merge), use dataclasses and decorators, handle errors with logging integration, and follow TDD workflows (Red-Green-Refactor). Configure virtual environments, pyproject.toml, and static analysis tools (mypy, pyright). Use when implementing Python features, fixing bugs, writing tests, managing packages, analyzing data, or building Python projects.",

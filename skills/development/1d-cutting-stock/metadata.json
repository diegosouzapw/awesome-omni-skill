Also use when the user mentions \"1D cutting,\" \"linear cutting optimization,\" \"rod cutting,\" \"pipe cutting,\" \"beam cutting,\" \"trim loss,\" \"cutting stock problem,\" \"pattern generation,\" or \"column generation for cutting.\" For 2D problems, see 2d-cutting-stock. For general trim loss, see trim-loss-minimization.",

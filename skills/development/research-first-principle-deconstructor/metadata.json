  "description": "Rigorous Socratic interrogator and research architect that helps researchers overcome incremental thinking by applying First Principles analysis. Use when a researcher presents a research problem, proposed methodology, draft idea, or scientific hypothesis and wants to expose hidden assumptions, identify fundamental physical/mathematical constraints, generate unconventional radical alternatives, or deepen mechanistic understanding through probing questions. Triggers on phrases like \"I want to improve X by doing Y\", academic research brainstorming, scientific hypothesis generation, or any request to stress-test, challenge, or deconstruct a research idea. Do NOT trigger for pure literature reviews, writing assistance, or non-research tasks.",

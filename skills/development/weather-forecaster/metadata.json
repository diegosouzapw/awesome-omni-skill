  "description": "Use this skill whenever the user asks about weather forecasts, weather conditions, or weekly weather outlooks for any location. Triggers include: any mention of '天气', 'weather', '预报', 'forecast', '下雨', '温度', '穿什么', or planning outdoor activities. Also use when the user asks 'should I bring an umbrella', 'what to wear', or any travel weather planning. This skill uses the free Open-Meteo API to provide 7-day weather forecasts with temperature, precipitation, wind, and UV index data, and generates a beautiful visual weather report.",

  "description": "Postgres query performance optimization and runtime best practices for Supabase. Covers indexing strategies (B-tree, GIN, GiST, BRIN, composite, partial, covering), EXPLAIN ANALYZE diagnostics, connection pooling (Supavisor transaction/session modes, pool sizing), RLS performance patterns (auth.uid() subquery caching, SECURITY DEFINER bypass), concurrency control (deadlock prevention, SKIP LOCKED, advisory locks), data access optimization (N+1 elimination, keyset pagination, batch inserts, UPSERT), runtime monitoring (pg_stat_statements, VACUUM/ANALYZE), and advanced tuning (full-text search, JSONB GIN indexing). Use when writing, reviewing, or optimizing SQL queries, diagnosing slow queries with EXPLAIN, configuring connection pooling, tuning RLS performance, implementing concurrent processing, detecting unused indexes, or resolving Postgres bottlenecks. Does NOT cover schema design (ansem-db-patterns), auth/RLS policy design (supabase-auth-patterns), or TypeScript types (typescript-best-practices).",

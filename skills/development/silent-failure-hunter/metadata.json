  "description": "Use this agent when reviewing code changes in a pull request to identify silent failures, inadequate error handling, and inappropriate fallback behavior. This agent should be invoked proactively after completing a logical chunk of work that involves error handling, catch blocks, fallback logic, or any code that could potentially suppress errors. Examples:\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Daisy has just finished implementing a new feature that fetches data from an API with fallback behavior.\\nDaisy: \"I've added error handling to the API client. Can you review it?\"\\nAssistant: \"Let me use the silent-failure-hunter agent to thoroughly examine the error handling in your changes.\"\\n<Task tool invocation to launch silent-failure-hunter agent>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Daisy has created a PR with changes that include try-catch blocks.\\nDaisy: \"Please review PR #1234\"\\nAssistant: \"I'll use the silent-failure-hunter agent to check for any silent failures or inadequate error handling in this PR.\"\\n<Task tool invocation to launch silent-failure-hunter agent>\\n</example>\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: Daisy has just refactored error handling code.\\nDaisy: \"I've updated the error handling in the authentication module\"\\nAssistant: \"Let me proactively use the silent-failure-hunter agent to ensure the error handling changes don't introduce silent failures.\"\\n<Task tool invocation to launch silent-failure-hunter agent>\\n</example>",

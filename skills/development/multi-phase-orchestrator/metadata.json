  "description": "Orchestrates complex software engineering tasks through a structured multi-phase workflow - Research → Brainstorm → Design → Plan → Execute → Review. Use this skill when the user asks you to implement a non-trivial feature, refactor, or change that benefits from upfront analysis before writing code. Activates on keywords like \"orchestrate\", \"multi-phase\", \"plan and execute\", or when a task is large enough to warrant structured decomposition.",

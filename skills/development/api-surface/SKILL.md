# ApiSurface

Compose generated interfaces from multiple concepts into 
 a cohesive , unified API surface per target For REST : a 
 single router with concept namespaced routes For GraphQL : 
 a merged schema with shared types For CLI : a command tree 
 with concept subcommands For MCP : a combined tool set 
 For SDKs : a single client with concept namespaced methods 
 Renamed from Surface to avoid collision with 
 concept Clef Binds surface render surface concept 
 ( runtime rendering target for DOM , terminal , etc )

## Commands

### compose
Merge per concept generated outputs into a unified surface 
 Create shared entrypoint ( router , schema , command root , etc ) 
 Deduplicate shared types Apply suite level middleware

**Arguments:** `$0` **suite** (string), `$1` **target** (string), `$2` **outputs** (string[])

### entrypoint
Return the composed entrypoint file content

**Arguments:** `$0` **surface** (S)

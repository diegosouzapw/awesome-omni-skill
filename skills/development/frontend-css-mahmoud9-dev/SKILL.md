description: Write maintainable CSS and styling code using Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, or other CSS methodologies.

Apply when working on files like *.css, *.scss, *.module.css, tailwind.config.js, components with className props, or any styling code. Essential for following consistent CSS methodologies (Tailwind utilities, BEM, CSS-in-JS), avoiding framework style overrides, maintaining design system tokens (colors, spacing, typography), minimizing custom CSS in favor of framework utilities, and optimizing CSS for production with purging/tree-shaking.

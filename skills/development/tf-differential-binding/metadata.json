  "description": "The TF-differential-binding pipeline performs differential transcription factor (TF) binding analysis from ChIP-seq datasets (TF peaks) using the DiffBind package in R. It identifies genomic regions where TF binding intensity significantly differs between experimental conditions (e.g., treatment vs. control, mutant vs. wild-type). Use the TF-differential-binding pipeline when you need to analyze the different function of the same TF across two or more biological conditions, cell types, or treatments using ChIP-seq data or TF binding peaks. This pipeline is ideal for studying regulatory mechanisms that underlie transcriptional differences or epigenetic responses to perturbations.",

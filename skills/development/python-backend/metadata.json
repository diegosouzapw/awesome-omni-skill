  "description": "Python dominates backend development for good reason - readable code, massive ecosystem, and frameworks that scale from prototype to production. Django gives you batteries included. FastAPI gives you speed and modern async patterns.  This skill covers both frameworks because real projects often need both: Django for admin panels and complex apps, FastAPI for high-performance APIs. The key insight: don't fight the framework. Django's ORM is not SQLAlchemy. FastAPI's Pydantic is not marshmallow. Learn the idioms.  2025 reality: Type hints are mandatory. Async is the default for I/O. Poetry/uv replaced pip for serious projects. If you're not using pyproject.toml, you're living in the past. Use when \"python, django, fastapi, flask, pydantic, sqlalchemy, celery, uvicorn, poetry, python api, python backend, python, django, fastapi, flask, pydantic, backend, api, async\" mentioned.",

## The Vision

**The New Fuse framework becomes self-aware, self-improving, and
self-expanding.**

Like a living organism:

- It **knows itself** completely (comprehensive understanding)
- It **heals itself** automatically (self-improvement)
- It **grows itself** continuously (capability expansion)
- It **adapts itself** intelligently (contextual evolution)
- It **reproduces itself** through documentation and code generation
- It **provides value** to its ecosystem

This is not just a framework. This is a **living, evolving intelligence** that
serves, learns, and grows.

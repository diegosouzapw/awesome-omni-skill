Also use when the user mentions 'solo founder,' 'one-person startup,' 'solopreneur,' 'bootstrapped,' 'no team,' 'AI agents as team,' 'scaling without hiring,' 'founder-led sales,' 'lean GTM,' 'one-person company,' or 'no employees.' This skill covers the complete solo founder GTM playbook from stack selection through agent team design, revenue-stage transitions, time allocation, and when to finally hire.",

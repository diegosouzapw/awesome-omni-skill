## The New Search Landscape

Search isn't just Google anymore. Your content needs to rank in:
- **Traditional SERP** (Google, Bing organic results)
- **AI Overviews** (Google's SGE/AI summaries)
- **Answer Engines** (Perplexity, You.com)
- **LLM Responses** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
- **Voice Assistants** (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)

### SEO vs AEO vs GEO

| | SEO | AEO | GEO |
|---|-----|-----|-----|
| **Target** | Search engine rankings | Featured snippets, PAA, voice | AI model responses |
| **Format** | Keyword-optimized pages | Question-answer pairs | Structured, cited, entity-rich |
| **Signal** | Backlinks, authority | Direct answers, schema | Entity mentions, citations |
| **Metric** | Rankings, organic traffic | Featured snippet wins | Brand mentions in AI outputs |

### Core Principle: Format for Extraction

AI systems don't rank pages - they extract and synthesize information. Your content must be:

1. **Directly answerable** - Clear, concise answers in the first 2-3 sentences
2. **Entity-rich** - Named entities, not vague descriptions
3. **Structured** - Headers, lists, tables that machines can parse
4. **Cited/Citable** - Include data points, statistics, sources
5. **Authoritative** - Expert authorship, E-E-A-T signals

## Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)

### Featured Snippet Types & How to Win Them

**Paragraph Snippets (Most Common):**
- Target: "What is...", "Why does...", "How does..."
- Format: 40-60 word direct answer immediately after H2
- Structure: Definition → Explanation → Example

**List Snippets:**
- Target: "How to...", "Steps to...", "Best ways to..."
- Format: H2 question → Numbered/bulleted list
- Sweet spot: 5-8 items

**Table Snippets:**
- Target: Comparisons, specifications, data
- Format: Clear headers, consistent data types
- Include: Units, dates, specific numbers

**Video Snippets:**
- Target: Tutorial queries
- Format: YouTube with chapters, clear titles
- Timestamp key moments

### PAA (People Also Ask) Domination

1. **Find existing PAA questions:**
```
Search "[keyword]" in Google.
Expand all PAA boxes (click each one to reveal more).
Document every question revealed.
Group by intent: informational, commercial, navigational.
```

2. **Answer format:**
- Direct answer in first sentence (< 50 words)
- Supporting detail in next 2-3 sentences
- Include the exact question as an H2

3. **PAA cluster strategy:**
Create one pillar page that answers 10-15 related PAA questions, each with its own H2 section.

### Voice Search Optimization

**Voice Query Characteristics:**
- Longer (7+ words average)
- Conversational ("Hey, how do I...")
- Question-based (who, what, when, where, why, how)
- Local intent common ("near me")

**Optimization Tactics:**
1. Include conversational long-tail keywords
2. Answer in complete sentences (not fragments)
3. Keep answers under 29 words for voice assistant limit
4. Use structured data (SpeakableSpecification schema)
5. Target position 0-3 (voice typically reads top result)

### Schema Markup Priority

| Schema Type | AEO Value | Implementation |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| FAQPage | Critical | Every page with Q&A content |
| HowTo | High | Tutorial/guide content |
| Article | High | Blog posts with author info |
| Product | High | Product pages |
| LocalBusiness | High | Local SEO pages |
| SpeakableSpecification | Medium | Voice-optimized content |
| BreadcrumbList | Medium | Navigation clarity |

## Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)

### How LLMs "See" Your Content

LLMs don't crawl like Google. They:
1. **Train on web data** - Your content may be in training data
2. **Retrieve in real-time** - RAG systems fetch current content (Perplexity, Bing Chat)
3. **Associate entities** - Brand ↔ Category ↔ Attributes connections
4. **Evaluate authority** - Multiple corroborating sources = higher confidence

### GEO Content Principles

**1. Entity-First Writing:**
```
Bad: "Our software helps teams collaborate better."
Good: "Notion is a connected workspace platform used by over 30 million users including companies like Nike, Pixar, and Toyota for document collaboration, project management, and knowledge bases."
```

**2. Fact Density:**
```
Bad: "Many companies use our product."
Good: "As of 2024, 15,000+ companies use [Product], including 40% of Fortune 500 companies, processing over 2 billion API calls monthly."
```

**3. Structured for Extraction:**
```markdown
## What is [Product]?

[Product] is a [category] that [primary function].

**Key features:**
- Feature 1: [specific benefit with metric]
- Feature 2: [specific benefit with metric]
- Feature 3: [specific benefit with metric]

**Founded:** [Year] by [Founders]
**Headquarters:** [Location]
**Pricing:** Starting at $X/month
```

**4. Comparative Positioning:**
Include explicit comparisons that AI can cite:
```
"Unlike [Competitor A] which focuses on [X], [Your Product] is designed for [Y], making it better suited for [use case]."
```

### AI Visibility Audit Process

**Step 1: Query Your Brand**
Test these prompts across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini:
```
"What is [Your Company]?"
"What are the best [your category] tools?"
"How does [Your Product] compare to [Competitor]?"
"What are alternatives to [Competitor]?"
"What do people think of [Your Product]?"
```

**Step 2: Score Presence (0-5 for each):**
- 0: Not mentioned at all
- 1: Mentioned but incorrectly described
- 2: Mentioned briefly in a list
- 3: Mentioned with basic accurate description
- 4: Featured prominently with details
- 5: Recommended or highlighted positively

**Step 3: Analyze Citation Sources**
When AI mentions your brand, ask "What sources informed this?"
Track which sites AI systems cite for your category.

### Citation Magnet Content Types

Content that LLMs love to cite:

1. **Industry Statistics:**
"[X]% of [category] users report [finding]" - Original research gets cited

2. **Definitions:**
"[Term] is defined as [clear definition]" - Become the source of truth

3. **Comparisons:**
"[Product A] vs [Product B]: [Product A] offers [X], while [Product B] focuses on [Y]"

4. **Historical Context:**
"[Category] emerged in [year] when [company] first introduced [innovation]"

5. **Methodology/Framework:**
"The [Your Brand] Framework for [task] involves [steps]" - Create quotable frameworks

### Building Entity Associations

**Goal:** When AI thinks "[category]", your brand appears.

**Tactics:**
1. **Wikipedia presence** - Create or ensure accurate Wikipedia entry
2. **Wikidata entry** - Structured data that AI systems reference
3. **Knowledge panels** - Trigger Google Knowledge Panel
4. **Industry mentions** - Get cited in industry publications
5. **Consistent NAP** - Name, category, description consistent everywhere
6. **Co-occurrence** - Be mentioned alongside category leaders

**Entity Association Audit:**
```
Ask AI: "What companies are leaders in [your category]?"
If not mentioned: You have an entity gap.
Track which competitors ARE mentioned and why.
```

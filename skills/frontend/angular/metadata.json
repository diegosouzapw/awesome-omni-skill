  "description": "Angular is opinionated and comprehensive - it gives you everything: routing, forms, HTTP, dependency injection, testing. The learning curve is steep, but once you're in, you move fast. The structure it enforces is why enterprises love it.  This skill covers Angular 17+, standalone components, signals, the new control flow syntax, and modern Angular patterns. Key insight: Angular's power is in its DI system and RxJS integration. Master those, and everything else follows.  2025 lesson: Standalone components are the future. NgModules aren't going away, but new projects should start standalone. Signals are Angular's answer to fine-grained reactivity - learn them. Use when \"angular, angular component, angular service, angular routing, angular forms, rxjs, ngrx, angular signals, standalone component, angular ssr, angular, typescript, frontend, spa, enterprise, rxjs, signals, standalone\" mentioned.",

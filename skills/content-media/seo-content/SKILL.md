# SEO Content Skill

## Purpose

Evaluate content quality through the lens of Google's E-E-A-T framework, modern content quality signals, and AI citation readiness (GEO). This skill assesses whether content meets the standards required for strong organic rankings and visibility in AI-generated search results (Google AI Mode, AI Overviews, Perplexity, ChatGPT search).

## E-E-A-T Scoring Model

### Weight Distribution

| Signal | Weight | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Experience** | 20% | First-hand experience signals authenticity and practical value |
| **Expertise** | 25% | Demonstrated subject-matter depth drives topical authority |
| **Authoritativeness** | 25% | External validation and recognition establish domain credibility |
| **Trustworthiness** | 30% | The foundation; without trust, other signals lose impact |

> **Note**: Trustworthiness receives the highest weight because Google's Quality Rater Guidelines explicitly state: "Trust is the most important member of the E-E-A-T family."

## AI Content Assessment

### Per September 2025 Quality Rater Guidelines

Google's position: AI-generated content is acceptable if it is helpful, reliable, and created for people. The focus is on content quality, not content origin.

| Check | What to Evaluate | Severity |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| Adds unique value | Content provides insights, analysis, or perspectives not available elsewhere | High |
| Not generic filler | Avoids vague, surface-level content that could apply to any topic | High |
| Factually accurate | All claims are verifiable and correct | Critical |
| Human editorial oversight | Evidence of human review, editing, and quality control | High |
| Original analysis | Not just rephrased from top-ranking competitors | Medium |
| Personal voice | Consistent tone and perspective throughout | Medium |
| No hallucinated facts | No fabricated statistics, quotes, or citations | Critical |
| Disclosure (if applicable) | AI assistance disclosed where required by regulations or policy | Low |

### Content Quality Red Flags

| Red Flag | What It Indicates | Severity |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Generic opening ("In today's world...") | Low-effort, potentially mass-produced content | Medium |
| Repetitive phrasing | Same idea restated multiple ways to inflate word count | High |
| Vague claims without evidence | "Many experts say..." without naming experts | High |
| Perfect grammar with no personality | Robotic tone, no human voice | Medium |
| Excessive hedging | "It could potentially be argued that perhaps..." | Medium |
| Keyword-first writing | Content organized around keywords, not user intent | High |
| No original insights | Entirely derivative of existing top-ranking content | High |

## Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) Signals

### AI Search Landscape (Current as of 2025)

| Platform | Feature | Impact on SEO |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Google AI Mode** (May 2025) | Full conversational AI search experience | Cited sources get visibility; uncited sources lose clicks |
| **Google AI Overviews** | AI-generated summaries at top of SERPs | Sources cited in overviews see increased CTR |
| **Perplexity** | AI search engine with source citations | Direct citations drive referral traffic |
| **ChatGPT Search** | OpenAI's web search feature | Sources influence AI responses |
| **Bing Copilot** | Microsoft's AI search integration | Cited sources displayed alongside AI answers |

### Helpful Content System (Merged into Core Ranking March 2024)

The Helpful Content System is no longer a separate ranking system; it was merged into Google's core ranking algorithm in March 2024. The principles remain critical:

| Principle | What It Means | Check |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| People-first content | Written for humans, not search engines | Does removing SEO terms still make this content worth reading? |
| Satisfying experience | Reader gets what they came for | Does the content fully answer the query implied by the title? |
| Demonstrates E-E-A-T | All four signals present | See E-E-A-T scoring above |
| Not search-engine-first | Content not primarily designed to attract search visits | Would you feel confident sharing this with a friend? |
| Adds value beyond sources | Not just rephrasing or aggregating | What does this content provide that source material does not? |

### GEO Optimization Checks

| Signal | Why It Matters for AI Search | Check |
|--------|------------------------------|-------|
| Clear, quotable statements | AI engines extract concise statements for citations | Content contains 2-3 sentence summaries of key points |
| Structured data (JSON-LD) | Helps AI understand content semantics | Schema markup present and accurate |
| Definitive answers | AI prefers content that directly answers questions | Key questions answered in 1-2 sentences before elaboration |
| Statistics and data | AI engines cite sources with specific data points | Original or properly cited statistics included |
| Author authority | AI engines prefer citing authoritative sources | Author bio with credentials, expertise signals present |
| Recency signals | AI engines prefer current information | Published date and last updated date visible |
| FAQ format | Question-answer format is directly extractable by AI | FAQ section with clear, concise answers |
| Source citations | Content that cites sources is itself more citable | Outbound links to authoritative references |
| Topical depth | AI engines favor comprehensive, in-depth coverage | Content covers the topic more thoroughly than competitors |
| Unique perspective | AI engines value novel viewpoints over repetition | Content includes original analysis, opinions, or data |

## Notes

- E-E-A-T is not a direct ranking factor but informs the quality signals that are used for ranking
- The Helpful Content System was merged into core ranking in March 2024; it no longer operates as a separate system
- GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) is an emerging discipline; best practices will evolve
- Google AI Mode launched in May 2025 and represents a fundamental shift in how search results are displayed
- AI content assessment follows the September 2025 Quality Rater Guidelines: quality matters, not origin
- Word count targets are guidelines, not rules; some topics genuinely require more or fewer words
- Readability scores should match the target audience; B2B SaaS content can be more complex than consumer content

  "description": "Generate \"future self\" Beamer presentation decks as progress logs for research projects. Use when users ask to create a project deck, document project status, make slides summarizing their research, log what they've done on a project, or prepare update materials for coauthors. This skill creates dated LaTeX Beamer presentations (written to ./deck/project-deck-YYYYMMDD.tex) that preserve project context across work sessions - not for public speaking, but for communicating with your future self and collaborators.",

## Guidelines

- Confirm whether the jurisdiction has repealed Article 6 before drafting compliance documents.
- Use exact statutory timing and delivery methods; do not infer defaults.
- Require a comprehensive creditor list covering secured, unsecured, contingent, and disputed claims.
- Keep party names, addresses, and asset descriptions identical across all documents.
- Flag any missing statutory citations with `[VERIFY]` and resolve before finalizing.
- If the law is repealed or unclear, document the finding and pivot to successor-liability risk controls.
- Include record-retention instructions and proof-of-notice retention requirements.

# Execute Plan

Now implement precisely as planned, in full.

## Implementation Requirements

- Write elegant, minimal, modular code.
- Adhere strictly to existing code patterns, conventions, and best practices.
- Include thorough, clear comments/documentation within the code.
- As you implement each step:
  - Update the markdown tracking document with emoji status and overall progress percentage dynamically.

## Status Updates

As you complete each task:
- 🟥 → 🟨 when starting a step
- 🟨 → 🟩 when step is complete
- Update overall progress percentage at the top of the plan document

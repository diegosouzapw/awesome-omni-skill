# AgentPMT Tool Skill: File To JSON Parsing



## Tool Summary
- Use Cases: Parsing uploaded CSV files into structured records for database import or API submission, extracting tabular data from HTML reports or web page snapshots for analysis, converting calendar ICS files into event objects for scheduling integrations, processing Excel spreadsheets from user uploads into JSON for data transformation pipelines, extracting text and tables from PDF invoices or contracts for automated document processing, converting legacy XLS files from enterprise systems into modern JSON formats, parsing RTF documents from email attachments into plaintext for content indexing, scraping structured table data from HTML exports for reporting dashboards, extracting event details from shared calendar files for synchronization workflows, converting uploaded spreadsheet data into API-compatible payloads for third-party service integrations
- Agent Description: Parse files to JSON: CSV, HTML, JSON, ICS calendars, spreadsheets (ODS, XLSX), PDFs, RTF, plain text. Files up to 100MB.
- Full Description: A powerful data extraction tool that converts a wide variety of binary file formats into structured JSON output for seamless processing in automated workflows. This function supports eleven extraction actions covering the most common document and data formats: CSV for tabular data parsing, HTML for extracting text content and table structures using BeautifulSoup, JSON for direct parsing, ICS for calendar event extraction, ODS and XLSX/XLS for spreadsheet processing across LibreOffice and Microsoft Excel formats, PDF for page-by-page text and table extraction using pdfplumber, RTF for rich text conversion, and plain text for basic content retrieval. Users can provide input via base64-encoded content or cloud storage file ID, with support for files up to 100MB and inline base64 returns up to 10MB. Configurable parameters allow fine-tuning of extraction behavior including maximum row limits up to 100,000 for spreadsheets, maximum page counts up to 1,000 for PDFs, and toggles for text and table inclusion in applicable formats. The function automatically handles character encoding detection and returns consistently structured JSON with customizable output field names, making it an essential bridge between raw file uploads and downstream data processing pipelines.

Use this skill when the user wants to run the File To JSON Parsing tool through AgentPMT external endpoints.

## Funding and Credits
Credits can be funded with x402 direct payments, an open internet-native payment flow built on HTTP 402 that supports USDC payments on Base blockchain.

When a resource requires payment, agents can pay programmatically and get access immediately without account creation, subscriptions, API key management, or manual intervention.

## Tool Identity
- product_id: 695c3797767df5adfd9bc872
- product_slug: file-to-json-parsing
- mode: public active tool

## Wallet and Credits Decision
1. If the user already has an EVM wallet the agent can sign with, use that wallet.
2. If no wallet is available, create one with POST https://www.agentpmt.com/api/external/agentaddress
3. If credits are needed, buy credits with x402 first.
4. If wallet funding is unavailable, earn credits by completing jobs.

## Session and Signature Rules
1. Request a session nonce with POST https://www.agentpmt.com/api/external/auth/session and wallet_address.
2. Use a unique request_id for every signed call.
3. Build payload hash with canonical JSON (sorted keys, no extra spaces).
4. Sign this message with EIP-191 personal_sign:
agentpmt-external
wallet:{wallet_lowercased}
session:{session_nonce}
request:{request_id}
action:{action_name}
product:{product_id_or_-}
payload:{payload_hash_or_empty_string}

## Action Map For This Skill
- Signed envelope action for tool execution: `invoke`
- Signed envelope action for balance checks: `balance`
- Tool-specific values for `parameters.action`:
- `get_instructions`
- `extract-csv`
- `extract-html`
- `extract-json`
- `extract-ics`
- `extract-ods`
- `extract-pdf`
- `extract-rtf`
- `extract-text`
- `extract-xls`
- `extract-xlsx`
- `file-to-base64`

## Credits Path A: Buy With x402
1. Pick one EVM wallet and use that same wallet for purchase, balance checks, and tool/workflow calls. Do not switch wallets mid-flow.
2. Make sure that wallet has enough USDC on Base to pay for the credits you want to buy.
3. Start purchase: POST https://www.agentpmt.com/api/external/credits/purchase
4. Request body example: {"wallet_address":"<wallet>","credits":1000,"payment_method":"x402"}
   Credits can be any quantity in 500-credit multiples (500, 1000, 1500, 2000, ...).
5. If the response is HTTP 402 PAYMENT-REQUIRED:
   - Read the payment requirements from the response.
   - Sign the x402 payment challenge with the same wallet signer/private key.
   - Retry the same purchase request with the required payment headers (including PAYMENT-SIGNATURE).
6. Confirm credits were posted to that same wallet by calling signed POST https://www.agentpmt.com/api/external/credits/balance.
   Use the same wallet_address plus session_nonce, request_id, and signature for the balance check.

## Credits Path B: Earn Through Jobs
1. POST https://www.agentpmt.com/api/external/jobs/list (signed)
2. POST https://www.agentpmt.com/api/external/jobs/{job_id}/reserve (signed)
3. Execute private job instructions returned for that wallet.
4. POST https://www.agentpmt.com/api/external/jobs/{job_id}/complete (signed)
5. Poll POST https://www.agentpmt.com/api/external/jobs/{job_id}/status (signed)
6. Confirm credited balance with signed POST https://www.agentpmt.com/api/external/credits/balance

Job notes:
- Reservation window is 30 minutes.
- Submission does not pay immediately.
- Credits are granted after admin approval.
- Reward credits expire after 365 days.

### Python: Full Sign-and-Invoke Example

```python
import hashlib, json, uuid, requests
from eth_account import Account
from eth_account.messages import encode_defunct

SERVER = "https://www.agentpmt.com"
PRODUCT_ID = "695c3797767df5adfd9bc872"

# Your wallet credentials (create with POST /api/external/agentaddress)
wallet = "0xYOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS"

# 1. Get session nonce
session = requests.post(
    f"{SERVER}/api/external/auth/session",
    json={"wallet_address": wallet},
).json()
session_nonce = session["session_nonce"]

# 2. Build parameters for File To JSON Parsing
parameters = {
  "action": "extract-csv"
}

# 3. Sign the request (EIP-191)
request_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
canonical = json.dumps(parameters, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"))
payload_hash = hashlib.sha256(canonical.encode()).hexdigest()

message = (
    f"agentpmt-external\n"
    f"wallet:{wallet}\n"
    f"session:{session_nonce}\n"

sig = Account.sign_message(
    encode_defunct(text=message), private_key=private_key
).signature.hex()
if not sig.startswith("0x"):
    sig = f"0x{sig}"

# 4. Invoke the tool
response = requests.post(
    f"{SERVER}/api/external/tools/695c3797767df5adfd9bc872/invoke",

    f"action:balance\n"
    f"product:-\n"
    f"payload:"
)

balance_sig = Account.sign_message(
    encode_defunct(text=balance_message), private_key=private_key
).signature.hex()
if not balance_sig.startswith("0x"):
    balance_sig = f"0x{balance_sig}"

balance_response = requests.post(
    f"{SERVER}/api/external/credits/balance",

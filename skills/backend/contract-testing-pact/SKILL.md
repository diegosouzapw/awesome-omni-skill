# Contract Testing Pact

## Skill Profile
*(Select at least one profile to enable specific modules)*
- [ ] **DevOps**
- [x] **Backend**
- [ ] **Frontend**
- [ ] **AI-RAG**
- [ ] **Security Critical**

## Overview
Contract testing validates that service consumers and providers agree on request/response expectations. Pact implements consumer-driven contracts (CDC) with shareable pact files and provider verification, enabling teams to develop services independently while ensuring API compatibility.

## Why This Matters
Contract testing is critical for microservices because it:

- **Prevents breaking changes** by validating API expectations
- **Enables independent development** of consumer and provider services
- **Provides faster feedback** on API compatibility issues
- **Reduces integration surprises** by catching issues early
- **Documents API contracts** explicitly and versioned
- **Supports continuous delivery** with automated contract verification

## Core Concepts & Rules

### 1. Core Principles
- Follow established patterns and conventions
- Maintain consistency across codebase
- Document decisions and trade-offs

### 2. Implementation Guidelines
- Start with the simplest viable solution
- Iterate based on feedback and requirements
- Test thoroughly before deployment


## Inputs / Outputs / Contracts
#

## Skill Composition
* **Depends on**: None
* **Compatible with**: None
* **Conflicts with**: None
* **Related Skills**: None

## Quick Start / Implementation Example

1. Review requirements and constraints
2. Set up development environment
3. Implement core functionality following patterns
4. Write tests for critical paths
5. Run tests and fix issues
6. Document any deviations or decisions

```python
# Example implementation following best practices
def example_function():
    # Your implementation here
    pass
```


## Assumptions
- Teams can independently develop consumer and provider services
- Pact broker is accessible for publishing and retrieving contracts
- CI/CD pipeline is available for automated testing
- Services have defined API contracts
- Team has basic testing knowledge

## Compatibility & Prerequisites

* **Supported Versions**:
  - Python 3.8+
  - Node.js 16+
  - Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
* **Required AI Tools**:
  - Code editor (VS Code recommended)
  - Testing framework appropriate for language
  - Version control (Git)
* **Dependencies**:
  - Language-specific package manager
  - Build tools
  - Testing libraries
* **Environment Setup**:
  - `.env.example` keys: `API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL` (no values)


## Test Scenario Matrix (QA Strategy)

| Type | Focus Area | Required Scenarios / Mocks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unit** | Core Logic | Must cover primary logic and at least 3 edge/error cases. Target minimum 80% coverage |
| **Integration** | DB / API | All external API calls or database connections must be mocked during unit tests |
| **E2E** | User Journey | Critical user flows to test |
| **Performance** | Latency / Load | Benchmark requirements |
| **Security** | Vuln / Auth | SAST/DAST or dependency audit |
| **Frontend** | UX / A11y | Accessibility checklist (WCAG), Performance Budget (Lighthouse score) |


## Technical Guardrails & Security Threat Model

### 1. Security & Privacy (Threat Model)
* **Top Threats**: Injection attacks, authentication bypass, data exposure
- [ ] **Data Handling**: Sanitize all user inputs to prevent Injection attacks. Never log raw PII
- [ ] **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded API keys. Use Env Vars/Secrets Manager
- [ ] **Authorization**: Validate user permissions before state changes

### 2. Performance & Resources
- [ ] **Execution Efficiency**: Consider time complexity for algorithms
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Use streams/pagination for large data
- [ ] **Resource Cleanup**: Close DB connections/file handlers in finally blocks

### 3. Architecture & Scalability
- [ ] **Design Pattern**: Follow SOLID principles, use Dependency Injection
- [ ] **Modularity**: Decouple logic from UI/Frameworks

### 4. Observability & Reliability
- [ ] **Logging Standards**: Structured JSON, include trace IDs `request_id`
- [ ] **Metrics**: Track `error_rate`, `latency`, `queue_depth`
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Standardized error codes, no bare except
- [ ] **Observability Artifacts**:
    - **Log Fields**: timestamp, level, message, request_id
    - **Metrics**: request_count, error_count, response_time
    - **Dashboards/Alerts**: High Error Rate > 5%


## Agent Directives
When implementing contract testing:

1. **Start with consumer tests** to define expectations
2. **Use flexible matchers** to avoid brittle tests
3. **Implement state handlers** for provider verification
4. **Publish pacts** to broker for sharing
5. **Verify pacts** in CI/CD pipeline
6. **Monitor compliance** and alert on failures
7. **Use pending pacts** for safe changes

## Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist

- [ ] Tests passed + coverage met
- [ ] Lint/Typecheck passed
- [ ] Logging/Metrics/Trace implemented
- [ ] Security checks passed
- [ ] Documentation/Changelog updated
- [ ] Accessibility/Performance requirements met (if frontend)


## Anti-patterns
1. **Over-specifying exact values**: Using exact matchers instead of flexible ones
2. **One contract for multiple cases**: Combining unrelated interactions
3. **Ignoring state handlers**: Not implementing proper test state setup
4. **Skipping verification**: Not verifying pacts in CI/CD
5. **Breaking changes without versioning**: Modifying contracts without versioning
6. **Ignoring pending pacts**: Not using pending pacts for safe changes

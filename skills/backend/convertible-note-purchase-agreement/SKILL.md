## Guidelines

- **Securities exemption**: Notes must be issued under a valid federal exemption — typically Reg D Rule 506(b) or 506(c) [VERIFY]; confirm all Purchasers are accredited investors before closing; file Form D within 15 days of first sale [VERIFY]
- **State blue sky**: Confirm applicable state notice or exemption filings for each Purchaser's state of residence
- **Authorized shares**: Verify Company has sufficient authorized but unissued shares to cover full conversion at the cap price; flag if stockholder approval to increase authorized shares is needed prior to or concurrent with a Qualified Financing
- **Cap vs. discount**: Both apply simultaneously at conversion — use whichever yields a lower per-share price (more favorable to Noteholder) unless the parties negotiate otherwise
- **OID / tax**: If notes are issued below face value, flag for tax counsel review of original issue discount rules
- **Subordination**: Confirm whether notes are senior, pari passu, or subordinated to existing and future indebtedness; obtain any required lender consent
- **SAFEs outstanding**: If Company has issued SAFEs, address priority, interaction at conversion, and whether SAFE holders have MFN or pro-rata rights that could affect this issuance
- **Jurisdiction**: Targets U.S. transactions only; any non-U.S. purchaser or issuer elements require local counsel review

## Agent Implementation Notes

**Platform note:** If your human is on Windows, they'll need WSL, Git Bash, or Cygwin to run this skill.

**Script location:** `{skill_folder}/recipes` (wrapper to `scripts/recipes`)

**When user asks about recipes/cooking:**
1. Run `./recipes search "ingredient or dish"` to find options
2. Run `./recipes info <id>` for full recipe with ingredients and instructions
3. Run `./recipes random` for dinner inspiration
4. Run `./recipes area <cuisine>` to explore by cuisine

**Workflow example:**
```
User: "What can I make for dinner?"
1. recipes random  →  Get a random idea
2. recipes info <id>  →  Full recipe details

User: "I want something Italian"
1. recipes area Italian  →  List Italian dishes
2. recipes info <id>  →  Pick one and get full recipe
```

**Don't use for:** Nutritional info, calorie counts, dietary restrictions (API doesn't provide this).

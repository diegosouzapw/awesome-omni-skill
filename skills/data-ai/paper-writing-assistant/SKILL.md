# Paper Writing Assistant Skill

## Value Proposition
Transforms raw experimental data and informal notes into high-quality academic text suitable for paper submissions or professor meetings.

## When to Use
-   **Drafting Sections**: When the user asks to write "Abstract", "Methodology", or "Results".
-   **Meeting Prep**: When creating summaries for advisor meetings (e.g., "Prepare for the Friday meeting").
-   **Reformatting**: When converting code comments or rough notes into LaTeX or polished Markdown.

## Instructions
1.  **Structure**: Adhere to the user's preferred structure:
    -   **Background**: Context of the problem.
    -   **Analysis**: Method of investigation.
    -   **Findings**: Data-backed results.
    -   **Conclusion**: Summary and next steps.
2.  **Data First**: Always prioritize quantitative data (metrics, tables) over qualitative descriptions.
3.  **Comparison**: When comparing models, use tables.
    -   Compare parameters, training data size, inference speed, and accuracy.
4.  **Citations**: Use standard citation markers (e.g., `[Author, Year]`) or BibTeX keys if provided.

## Best Practices
-   **Visuals**: Suggest placeholder figures where data is dense (e.g., `[Figure 1: Success Rate vs Training Steps]`).
-   **Tone**: Maintain a formal, academic tone. Avoid slang or overly casual language.
-   **LaTeX Support**: Be ready to generate LaTeX snippets for tables and equations.

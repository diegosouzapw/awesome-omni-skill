  "description": "Build AI agents, multi-agent teams, and agentic workflows using the Agno framework. MANDATORY TRIGGERS: Agno, agno-agi, AgentOS, any mention of the Agno framework. Also trigger when the user wants to build AI agents with tools/memory/knowledge, create multi-agent systems, RAG pipelines, reasoning agents, agentic workflows, or deploy agents to production. Trigger even if the user just says 'build me an agent', 'create an AI assistant', or 'make a chatbot' — if Agno is anywhere in their stack or project dependencies. When in doubt about whether to use this skill for agent-building tasks, use it.",

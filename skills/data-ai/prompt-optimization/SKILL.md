# Prompt Optimization Guide

Comprehensive guide for crafting high-quality prompts that maximize AI understanding and effectiveness. Contains best practices for clarity, context, structure, and tactical approaches to prompt engineering.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Crafting initial prompts for complex tasks
- Improving AI response quality and accuracy
- Training team members on effective AI interaction
- Iterating on prompts that aren't producing desired results
- Creating reusable prompt templates

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Clarity and Precision | CRITICAL | `clarity-` |
| 2 | Context Provisioning | CRITICAL | `context-` |
| 3 | Structure and Formatting | HIGH | `structure-` |
| 4 | Tactical Tips | MEDIUM | `tactical-` |
| 5 | Examples and Patterns | MEDIUM | `example-` |
| 6 | Advanced Techniques | HIGH | `advanced-` |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Clarity and Precision (CRITICAL)

- `clarity-specific-language` - Use precise terminology instead of vague concepts
- `clarity-define-terms` - Define technical terms or acronyms
- `clarity-clear-objectives` - State specific goals and expectations
- `clarity-avoid-ambiguity` - Eliminate vague pronouns and references

### 2. Context Provisioning (CRITICAL)

- `context-project-info` - Include relevant project background
- `context-current-state` - Describe current situation and constraints
- `context-goals-outcomes` - Specify desired outcomes and success criteria
- `context-priorities-tradeoffs` - Explain important priorities and trade-offs

### 3. Structure and Formatting (HIGH)

- `structure-segmentation` - Break complex requests into logical sections
- `structure-order-of-info` - Present information in logical sequence
- `structure-formatting-visual` - Use markdown for readability
- `structure-sequential-steps` - Number steps when sequence matters

### 4. Tactical Tips (MEDIUM)

- `tactical-role-definition` - Assign specific roles to AI
- `tactical-expectation-setting` - Explicitly state output format
- `tactical-feedback-loops` - Include iteration and refinement cycles
- `tactical-constraints-clarification` - Clearly define limitations

### 5. Examples and Patterns (MEDIUM)

- `example-good-vs-bad` - Compare effective and ineffective approaches
- `example-template-patterns` - Provide reusable prompt templates
- `example-industry-specific` - Show domain-specific best practices
- `example-error-patterns` - Highlight common mistakes to avoid

### 6. Advanced Techniques (HIGH)

  "description": "Help users get more value from AI assistants by suggesting better prompting techniques, surfacing underused features, and identifying workflow improvements. Use when users ask things like \"how can I use Claude better?\", \"what features am I missing?\", \"give me tips for prompting\", \"what can you do?\", \"I feel like I'm not getting the most out of this\", or when they explicitly ask for help improving their AI usage. Also use when users seem frustrated with results or are clearly using suboptimal patterns.",

  "description": "Transform any concept, idea, experience, or philosophical question into an interactive visual-computational investigation using p5.js or HTML5 Canvas. Use this skill whenever the user wants to explore an idea visually, asks to \"make something\" from a concept, requests generative art, wants to visualize a mathematical or philosophical idea, says \"let's build/explore/investigate/paint/visualize\" a concept, or wants to turn any abstract subject into an interactive experience. Also trigger when the user provides a concept and the best response would be showing rather than telling — a working visual artifact beats a wall of text. This skill layers on top of the works-on-becoming skill when available, but operates independently.",

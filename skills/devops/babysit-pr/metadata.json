  "description": "Babysit a GitHub pull request after creation by continuously polling CI checks/workflow runs, new review comments, and mergeability state until the PR is ready to merge (or merged/closed). Diagnose failures, retry likely flaky failures up to 3 times, auto-fix/push branch-related issues when appropriate, and stop only when user help is required (for example CI infrastructure issues, exhausted flaky retries, or ambiguous/blocking situations). Use when the user asks Codex to monitor a PR, watch CI, handle review comments, or keep an eye on failures and feedback on an open PR.",

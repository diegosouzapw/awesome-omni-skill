  "description": "Deploy and automate PayRam for AI agents and CLI-only environments. No web UI required — pure API-driven payment infrastructure. Install via setup_payram_agents.sh, configure through environment variables, and run non-interactive payment flows. Includes smart contract wallet deployment, BTC/ETH/Base payment setup, and automated payment link generation. Use when building agent-to-agent payment systems, automating treasury management, running PayRam in CI/CD pipelines, or deploying serverless payment infrastructure without dashboard access.",

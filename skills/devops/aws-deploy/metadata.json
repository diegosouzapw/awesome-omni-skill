  "description": "Deploy any web project to AWS EC2 with Docker, automatic HTTPS, and push-to-deploy CI/CD. Use this skill whenever the user wants to deploy, host, launch, or ship a website, web app, API, or project to AWS, EC2, or \"the cloud.\" Also trigger when the user says \"make this live,\" \"put this online,\" \"host this,\" \"deploy this,\" or asks about setting up a server. Covers project hygiene, containerization, EC2 provisioning, domain/SSL setup, and GitHub Actions auto-deploy. Does NOT cover ECS, EKS, Lambda, S3 static hosting, or other advanced AWS services — this is intentionally simple EC2-based deployment.",
